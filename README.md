Dish Decoder

Dish Decoder is a web application that extracts ingredients and cooking instructions from recipe URLs—removing personal stories, images, and advertisements for a clean, distraction-free reading experience.

The app reformats the content for clarity and offers multiple export options, including Markdown, PDF, and a dedicated ingredients-only grocery list. Users can also switch between light and dark mode for comfortable viewing.
